SQL Developer interview questions cover a range of topics, from basic SQL syntax to advanced database concepts and optimization techniques. Common questions include those related to data manipulation, joins, indexes, stored procedures, and data integrity. Additionally, interviewers may probe your understanding of normalization, performance tuning, and database design principles. [1, 2]
